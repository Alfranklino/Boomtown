# BOOMTOWN

Boomtown is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) based project where users can share and borrow some items. This project is full stack project. That means both the backend and the frontend have been developped. For that you will find inside the project Repo 2 folders: server and client. For the backend i used a [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as the API tool. The frontend is a pure ReactJs based code.

## Getting Started

Before being able to share your items, you should signup as user. Then, you can browse among other people articles and borrow them. Once you decide, it is needed, you have to return your borrowed articles. If you have some articles to share you can post them. You have the possibility to see the list of your shared (posted) and borrowed articles. You can also edit your profile.

### Prerequisites

In order for you to have the project up and running after downloading, you need to have NPM installed on your computer with a CLI working properly. Inside the package.json file you will notice as usually, all the dependencies required for you. Pay carefully attention to the build directory. It contains all the js and css files that you need. The file that you have to launch is the index.html.

### Installing

1. First, you need to install npm
2. Second, you need to install gulp and automatically all the dependencies will be installed.
3. Third, inside your CLI, just type the commands from both the server and the clients folders:

```
npm start
```

3. Test the project as needed.
